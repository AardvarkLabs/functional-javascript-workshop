### Teaching fundamental functional programming features of Javascript.

### No libraries required (i.e. no underscore), just ES5.

## Mission

The goal of this workshop is to create realistic problems that can be solved using vanilla, idomatic JavaScript.

Many functional programming learning resources will teach you to write functional code, but it's often highly indirect,
deeply abstracted, requires understanding complex relationships between custom library calls, and doesn't represent
the reality of how people actually write JavaScript.

If you come across a problem in your day-to-day work which was solved simply and elegantly with some functional JavaScript techniques, please help us create an exercise out of it.

## Stuck?

Feedback and critisism is welcome, please log your troubles in [issues](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop/issues). 

Full curriculum reviews [like this one](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop/issues/7) are incredibly helpful. More feedback like this please!

**Work in Progress.** New lessons will be added weekly and tested upon participants of the [SingaporeJS meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/).
