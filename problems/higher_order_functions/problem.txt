A higher-order function (also functional form, functional or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following:
* take one or more functions as an input
* output a function

All other functions are first order functions. [1]

Implement a higher-order function that takes a function and calls it 'n' times.

It's ok to use a loop in your implementation, bonus points
if you don't.
