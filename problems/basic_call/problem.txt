JavaScript implements 'duck' typing. Duck typing is a style of dynamic typing in
which an object's methods and properties determine the valid semantics,
rather than its inheritance from a particular class or implementation of a
specific interface. The name of the concept refers to the duck test, attributed
to James Whitcomb Riley, which may be phrased as follows:

  "When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck"

In JavaScript, in order to write robust programs we sometimes need to
check an object conforms to the type that we need.

We can use Object#hasOwnProperty to detect if an object 'has' a property defined on itself (i.e. not
inherited from its prototype):

```js

var duck = {
  quack: function() {
    console.log('quack')
  }
}

duck.hasOwnProperty('quack') // => true

```

We didn't give the duck a .hasOwnProperty method, where did it come from?

Duck was created with the `{}` syntax, and as such
it inherits from Object.prototype:

```js

var object = {quack: true}

Object.getPrototypeOf(object) === Object.prototype // => true
object.hasOwnProperty('quack')                     // => true

```

But what if an object doesn't inherit from Object.prototype?

```js

// create an object with 'null' prototype.
var object = Object.create(null)

Object.getPrototypeOf(object) === Object.prototype // => false
Object.getPrototypeOf(object) === null             // => true

object.hasOwnProperty('quack') // => TypeError: Object object has no method 'hasOwnProperty'

```

Task:

Write a function `duckCount` that returns the number of arguments passed to it which
have a property 'quack' defined directly on them. Do not match values inherited
from prototypes.

Arguments:

* You will be passed 0-20 arguments. Each argument could be of any type with any
  properties. Some of these items will have a 'quack' property.

Conditions:

* Do not use any for/while loops.
* Do not create any counter/accumulator variables.
* You do not need to define any additional functions
  unless a stub is provided in the boilerplate.

Hints:

* The arguments variable quacks like an Array.
